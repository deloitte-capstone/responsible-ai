# Fairness Assessments

## Class Coverage
* How can we assess algorithmic fairness? 
* What metrics are commonly used to measure fairness? 
* What can’t be captured in data?
* Class this week is on TUESDAY NOVEMBER 7TH!!

## Pre-Class Readings
Please read the following:
* [Ethical Machine Learning in Health Care](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-biodatasci-092820-114757) (Chen et al. 2021)
* [Millions of black people affected by racial bias in health-care algorithms](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03228-6) (Nature)

## Participation Questions 
_Submit to Gradescope by 11AM PT on Thursday, November 9th_
* “Individual fairness” refers to the practice of treating similar individuals similarly. What fairness metrics can you use to measure individual fairness?
* “Group fairness” refers to the process of equalizing some output metric(s) (positive predictions, error rates, etc.) across demographic subgroups. What fairness metrics can you use to measure group fairness?
* Can you think of any types of fairness other than individual and group? How would you measure them?
