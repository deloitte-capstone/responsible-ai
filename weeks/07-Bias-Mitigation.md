# Replication Project Part 03: Bias Mitigation

## Class Coverage
* Mitigating fairness issues in AI through pre-, in-, and post-processing
* Re-learning and re-deploying models. 

## Pre-Class Readings
Please read the following:
* [Model Cards for Model Reporting (Mitchell et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993)
* [Fairness Through Awareness (Dwork et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3913)
* [Demo: Explaining model behavior using LIME](https://nbviewer.org/github/Trusted-AI/AIF360/blob/master/examples/demo_lime.ipynb)

## Participation Questions 
_Submit to Gradescope by 10AM PT on , Thursday November 10th_
* In what situations do you think “fairness through awareness” is most appropriate? Are there any situations where “fairness through unawareness” is necessary instead?
* Describe a situation in which a pre-, in-, or post-processing technique might be appropriate for mitigating model bias, and explain what technique you would use.
