# Replication Project Part 0: Introduction

## Class Coverage
* Lecture: How do we run a data science project? What skills are necessary on AI teams? How can/do data scientists work effectively with other roles?
* What does the impossibility theorem mean for organizations employing AI?
* Should we just avoid using AI completely?
* What regulatory efforts help ascertain the definitions of fairness applicable to the use case?

## Pre-Class Readings
Please read the following:
* [AI fairness 360: an extensible toolkit for detecting, understanding, and mitigating unwanted algorithmic bias](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01943.pdf) (Bellamy et al.)
* [Datasheets for Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) (Gebru et al.)
* [AI Fairness 360 Demo](https://aif360.res.ibm.com/)

## This Week's Slides

## Assigned for Week 04
* Complete [next weekâ€™s](https://deloitte-capstone.github.io/responsible-ai/weeks/04-Replication-Part-01/) readings
* If you signed up to present on [**"Improving Fairness in Machine Learning Systems: What Do Industry Practitioners Need?" (Holstein et al.)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05239.pdf) come prepared to present.
* Complete default participation questions (activity or readings - up to you)
